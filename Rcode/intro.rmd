It is common in statistics that you measure many ``similar" things imperfectly, and wish to estimate their values. The situation arises commonly in the kinds of genomics applications I am often involved in, but also in other areas of statistics.
In genomics, for example, a very common goal
is to compare the mean
expression (activity) level of many genes in two conditions.
Let $\mu^0_j$ and $\mu^1_j$ denote the mean expression 
of gene $j$ ($j=1,\dots,J$) in the two conditions, and define $\beta_j:= \mu^0_j - \mu^1_j$ to be the difference. Typically expression
measurements are made on only a small number of
samples in each condition - sometimes as few as one
sample in each condition. Thus the error in estimates
of $\mu^0_j$ and $\mu^1_j$ is appreciable, and the error
in estimates of $\beta_j$ still greater.

A fundamental idea is
that the measurements of $\beta_j$ for each gene can be used to improve inference for the values of $\beta$ for other genes.
