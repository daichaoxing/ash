This repository contains ongoing work on Bayesian FDR and Adaptive Shrinkage.

To build the (in development) ashr package and install the library, from the R prompt run:
> require(devtools)
> install("../package/ashr")
Then restart your R session before loading the library
> library("ashr")

To get more information download the repository, and look at Rcode/intro.html and Rcode/readme.html

(These html files are generated from Rcode/intro.rmd and Rcode/readme.rmd and can be
reproduced using the R package knitr. R studio provides a nice interface to accomplish this.
See for example http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html)
