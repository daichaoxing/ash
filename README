This repository contains ongoing work on Bayesian FDR and Adaptive Shrinkage.

The (in development) ashr package is in package/ashr_0.1.tar.gz
To load this into R use:
> install.packages("truncnorm")
> install.packages("package/ashr_0.1.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")


The main function is ash. To get minimal help:
> ?ash

To get more information download the repository, and look at Rcode/intro.html and Rcode/readme.html

(These html files are generated from Rcode/intro.rmd and Rcode/readme.rmd and can be
reproduced using the R package knitr. R studio provides a nice interface to accomplish this.
See for example http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html)
