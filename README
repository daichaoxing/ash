This repository contains ongoing work on Bayesian FDR and Adaptive Shrinkage.

The (in development) ashr package is in package subdirectory.
There are two versions of the package, one which uses some C++ via RCpp, and one that does not.
The C++ version is faster, but the extra speed is likely only required if using ash 
many times on large data sets. Since installing the C++ version requires more
dependencies (e.g. you need to have a C++ compiler installed etc) you might want to start with 
the non C++ version.

To install the regular R version of the package use 
> install.packages("truncnorm")
> install.packages("package/ashr.no.cxx.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")

To install the Rcpp version of the package use 
> install.packages("truncnorm")
> install.packages("Rcpp")
> install.packages("package/ashr.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")


The main function is ash. To get minimal help:
> ?ash

To get more information download the repository, and look at Rcode/intro.html and Rcode/readme.html

(These html files are generated from Rcode/intro.rmd and Rcode/readme.rmd and can be
reproduced using the R package knitr. R studio provides a nice interface to accomplish this.
See for example http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html)
